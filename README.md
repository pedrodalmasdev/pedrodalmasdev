## I'm Pedro Dalmas ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering, where I spend my days writing code, solving problems, and occasionally wondering if semicolons have feelings. Iâ€™m passionate about building things that work â€” and even more about learning from the ones that almost do. When Iâ€™m not debugging at odd hours, Iâ€™m usually wandering in Arduino projects or getting lost in a tech article, both with aa cup of coffee with definitely healthy proportions by my side. I care deeply about clean code, thoughtful design, and staying curious in everything I do.
